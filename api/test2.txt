00:00 - My first million let's go. My first baby mama. My first camine experience. My first [laughter] [music] addiction. Here's what I want to start with. I love some of the things that you say and one of the things you said is don't follow your passion. People who are already rich tell you to follow your

00:30 - passion. You should follow your talent. Can you unpack that. Can you explain what you mean. I wanted to be an athlete that was my passion and then I'm going to UCLA was a blessing because I figured out pretty quickly that I wasn't in the 0.1%. You need to be in to make your living as an athlete. And there's a fair there's some pretty basic axioms that should guide your career choices around. Where you invest your most to. Precious capital and that is your time your human capital. The first is the sexier the business the lower return on investment

01:00 - you want to be in fashion the arts movies modeling. Sports inless you get really you know incandescent green lights from a very early age that you're going to be in the 0.1%. Try and make a living somewhere else and then do that on the weekends. And that is if you uh the SAG after the most talented actors in the world. It's hard to get a sag after a union card. You have to actually B something. These are the most talented doctors in the world 182,000 of

01:32 - them 87% of them don't qualify for health insurance because they don't make more than $23,000 in a given year. So the key is finding not finding your your passion but finding your talent and then committing to developing Mastery. And if you can develop Mastery in anything that has a 90 plus% employment rate which 98% of sectors enjoy the economic accurs the camaraderie The Prestige the relevance just the sheer Joy of Mastery will make you pass passate about whatever it is

02:03 - and I'm passionate about taking care of my kids. I'm passionate about being able to step in and help my aging father I'm passionate about. I'd rather be rapael nidal or Federer but kind of I'd rather be me than the number three or number four tennis player in the world because I have Financial Security. I get to go to Wimbledon on my own terms and not be as nervous and not throw up or before a match. So yeah I'd rather be n doll but pretty much any one else playing tennis I'd rather be. And I got there with boring companies so the the the the less

02:37 - sexy of business the higher the return on investment. So I would suggest that we stop. You know think about. Well what could I be good at. I think that's what your 20s are for. Workshopping stuff and and also getting it wrong. I started in Investment Banking and I was terrible at it. I didn't like them. They didn't like me and I had to go back to business school and just start workshopping. Where could I be great. What what industry could I be great in. So don't you know find what you're good at and then get great at it and then be a DJ on the weekends by the way

03:09 - congratulations today. The today's the release date of the book right. Algebra of wealth. Y. Today is the day so that's that's going to be huge. I mean I I I read the algebra of Happiness a while ago and I've been watching the videos forever and so I kind of I I didn't get an early copy of the book but I will buy it and read it and so you'll get my $23. I need you to. We're by the way we're number one on Amazon on today. I just thought I would drop that cuz I'm desperate. I'm desperate for your affirmation. Sam that's all right. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I won't starve you from that. You you've got it. I look up to you. I think you're

03:39 - the man. Thank you. Well let me let me ask you about the number one on Amazon real quick. You. Uh you're a pretty stoic guy. In fact when you come on the Pod it's uh it's always surprising to me that you are so even Keel. But it's the launch day of your book. You worked on this thing really hard. You're number one on Amazon. What. How does Scott Galloway. Uh. Celebrate. Oh you know I'm not. I'm pretty flat. I don't. I'm. I congratulate the team. It feels great. It's very gratifying. I love benchmarks. I'm addicted to everyone's addicted to something. I'm addicted to strangers. Affirmation. Which

04:10 - is kind of pathetic at my age and that's a form of affirmation. But it's very rewarding because so many people work so goddamn hard on this thing. Just not me. But you know my researchers my analysts my PR people my social people my publisher my book agent you know greatness is in the agency of others so it's just very gratifying. And plus my podcast co-host got to number three on the best sellers list so God damn it if I'm not going to get to number two I must beat Caris swisser. So Sam if you

04:42 - could go buy several thousand books. I'd appreciate it. Um and if you like it write a review and if you hate it please buy more and send them to an eneme. But yeah I'm I'm addicted to external affirmation. It's really pathetic. Well so I mean the the book from my
