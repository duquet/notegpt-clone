# üìù Notegpt-Clone: Summary System Changelog

## **Summary-Related Changes**

### **Backend**

- **Single Source of Truth for Templates**
  - All summary template definitions (titles, prompts, expected sections) are now stored in `@summaryPrompts.json`.
  - The backend loads this file for all summary-related logic.

- **Template Validation**
  - The backend validates incoming `templateType` against the keys in `summaryPrompts.json`.
  - Invalid template types are rejected with a clear error (no silent fallback).

- **API Endpoint for Template Configs**
  - New endpoint `/api/templates` returns a list of available template types and titles for the frontend to display.
  - Only minimal info (type, title) is sent‚Äîactual prompts remain backend-only.

- **Template-Specific Parsing (Planned/Proposed)**
  - Parsing logic will be moved to the backend.
  - After generating a summary, the backend will parse the AI response into structured JSON based on the template's `sections` array.
  - For special formats (e.g., quiz-flashcards), the backend will extract and return the JSON array.

- **API Response Format**
  - The `/api/summarize` endpoint will return structured JSON:
    - For section-based templates:  
      ```json
      {
        "templateType": "default",
        "title": "Summary",
        "sections": [
          { "name": "Summary", "content": "..." },
          { "name": "Highlights", "content": "..." },
          ...
        ]
      }
      ```
    - For quiz/flashcard templates:  
      ```json
      {
        "templateType": "quiz-flashcards",
        "title": "Interactive Quiz Cards",
        "flashcards": [ ... ]
      }
      ```

### **Frontend**

- **Dynamic Template List**
  - The frontend fetches available templates from `/api/templates` and displays them in the UI.
  - No hardcoded template titles or types in the frontend.

- **Template Validation**
  - The frontend validates user selection against the fetched template list.
  - If a mismatch occurs, a clear error is shown (no fallback to default).

- **Summary Card Rendering**
  - The frontend will render summary cards based on the structured JSON received from the backend.
  - No parsing of AI output or section headers in the frontend.
  - For flashcards, the frontend renders the provided array directly.

- **TypeScript Types**
  - Shared types/interfaces for summary templates and API responses have been added in `src/types/summary.ts`.

## **Other Notable Non-Summary Changes**

- **PDF Text Extraction & Caching**
  - PDF text extraction is now cached to avoid repeated uploads and redundant processing.

- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Added performance metrics logging for page load, video info fetch, transcript fetch, and summary generation.

- **Transcript Handling**
  - Improved chunked loading and segmentation of video transcripts for better performance and UX.

- **Error Handling**
  - Improved error handling and user feedback for template mismatches, API failures, and transcript issues.

- **UI/UX Improvements**
  - Dynamic rendering of template menus and summary cards.
  - Enhanced snackbar and alert system for user notifications.

---

## **Planned/Proposed Next Steps**

- Move all summary parsing logic to the backend, using the `sections` array in `summaryPrompts.json`.
- Ensure all summary API responses are structured JSON, not raw markdown.
- Update frontend to render summaries purely from structured data.
